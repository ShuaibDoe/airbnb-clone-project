# AirBnB Clone Project

## Overview
The **AirBnB Clone Project** is a full-stack web application that replicates the core features of the AirBnB platform.  
The goal is to build a functional clone that allows users to register, log in, list properties, book stays, and manage their bookings.

This project aims to strengthen skills in **web development**, **API design**, **database management**, and **frontend-backend integration**.

---

##  Project Goals
- Build a scalable web application using modern web technologies.
- Implement user authentication and session management.
- Design RESTful APIs for listing and booking properties.
- Create an intuitive and responsive user interface.
- Practice version control and team collaboration using Git and GitHub.

---

## Tech Stack
**Backend:**
- Python / Flask or Django  
- RESTful API design  
- SQLite or MySQL for database management  

**Frontend:**
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- React.js or basic Bootstrap-based UI  

**Version Control & Deployment:**
- Git & GitHub  
- Render / Heroku / AWS (for hosting)

## Technology Stack

- The AirBnB Clone Project leverages a modern, full-stack technology ecosystem designed for scalability, performance, and maintainability.
- Each component of the stack plays a specific role in delivering a seamless end-to-end user experience.

## Backend Technologies

-Django: A powerful Python web framework used for building the core backend logic, RESTful APIs, and handling authentication, authorization, and data models.
-Django REST Framework (DRF): Simplifies API development by providing tools for serialization, authentication, and request handling.
-GraphQL (optional): Enables flexible data queries, allowing clients to request only the data they need â€” improving performance and efficiency.

## Database

-PostgreSQL: A robust and scalable relational database used to store structured data such as users, properties, bookings, and reviews.
-SQLite (for development): A lightweight database used for local testing before deploying to production with PostgreSQL.

## Frontend Technologies

-HTML5 & CSS3: Used for building and styling the user interface, ensuring responsive and accessible layouts.
-JavaScript (ES6+): Adds interactivity and dynamic functionality to the web pages.
-React.js: A JavaScript library used for creating reusable UI components and managing client-side rendering efficiently.
-Bootstrap / Tailwind CSS: Speeds up UI development with pre-styled responsive components.

## Development & Version Control

-Git: Used for version control to track changes and collaborate effectively across team members.
-GitHub: Serves as the remote repository for code hosting, collaboration, and project management.

## Deployment & DevOps

-Docker: Containerizes the application to ensure consistency across development and production environments.
-Render / Heroku / AWS: Cloud platforms for deploying and hosting the application securely and reliably.
-CI/CD Pipelines: Automates testing and deployment to maintain continuous integration and delivery.

## Testing & Quality Assurance

-Pytest / Unittest: Frameworks for automated testing of backend logic and API endpoints.
-Postman: Used to test and debug RESTful APIs during development.
-Selenium / Cypress: Tools for end-to-end testing of frontend user flows.
